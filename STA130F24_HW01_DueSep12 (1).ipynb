    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "1. **Handling Missing Data in Datasets:**\n",
    "   - **`df.dropna()`:** Removes rows with any missing values. Useful when you want to ensure that all remaining rows have complete data but may result in loss of data if missing values are widespread.\n",
    "   - **`del df['col']`:** Removes specific columns from the DataFrame. Useful when a column has excessive missing values, and its removal is deemed necessary to prevent data loss from row deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - **`df.dropna()`:** Preferred when you want to maintain important columns and only remove rows with missing values. Example: Predictive modeling where keeping complete rows is critical.\n",
    "   - **`del df['col']`:** Preferred when a column has excessive missing values and its removal would prevent significant data loss. Example: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where focusing on relevant, complete columns is more beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining `del df['col']` and `df.dropna()`:**\n",
    "   - **Order Matters:** Remove columns with excessive missing data first to simplify the dataset. Then apply `df.dropna()` to ensure all remaining rows are complete, which is more efficient and reduces the risk of excessive data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Example:**\n",
    "   - **Dataset:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv`\n",
    "   - **Approach:**\n",
    "     - Remove columns with more than 50% missing values.\n",
    "     - Apply `df.dropna()` to remove rows with any remaining missing values.\n",
    "   - **Justification:**\n",
    "     - Simplifies the dataset and retains valuable features.\n",
    "     - Ensures remaining data is complete for accurate analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these strategies, you can effectively handle missing data and prepare your dataset for robust analysis or predictive modeling."

    "\n",
    "> This problem will guide you through exploring how to use a ChatBot to troubleshoot code using the \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv\" data set \n",
    "> \n",
    "> To initialially constrain the scope of the reponses from your ChatBot, start a new ChatBot session with the following slight variation on the initial prompting approach from \"2\" above\n",
    "> - \"I am going to do some initial simple summary analyses on the titanic data set I've downloaded (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv) which has some missing values, and I'd like to get your help understanding the code I'm using and the analysis it's performing\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. Use your ChatBot session to understand what `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the \"titanic\" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.  Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the `count` that result from doing something like `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Forget to include `import pandas as pd` in your code \n",
    "       <br> \n",
